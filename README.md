### WELCOME TO IVAN AND JEFFREY'S MUSEUM

![image]()

# Description
This virtual museum provides an experience comparable to visiting a real-life museum. You can freely move the camera, simulating the feeling of walking through the building and observing sculptures and paintings as if you were there in person.

However, instead of using fictional or replicas of real-life art, we decided to display the 3D rendered objects that were captured and worked on during HW 5 of our CS460 class in Fall 2024. 

Our inspiration for this project was to be able to creatively display everyone's models in an interactive environment.

If you would like to play the game, please go to the [Usage](#usage) section below.

# Usage

# Future Improvements
We recognize that the game has areas for improvement. 

First, we would like to improve the overall design of the Museum's interior and possibly experiment with an exterior section for the museum. We'd be able to do this with further experiementation of Models, Prefaces and Mesh Textures.

Second, we would also like to include as much model designs as possible to make this an ultimate comprehensive collection of models, perhaps for each following semesters (e.g: Fall 2024, Spring 2025, etc).

Third, we were experimenting with interactive features, the main one being a pop-out display of information pertaining to the art/model that was interacted with. Such information may include details such as a description of the item, it's creator, etc.

Fourth, we could also improve the movement and it's cohesion with the environment, as we do realize going up stairs is not as smooth as we'd like it to be, and there isn't much friction in the main player, as they accelerate.


# Authors and acknowledgment
Thanks to: 
- Ivan Wu for creating the Museum design itself, and implementing the models, and scripting of the character movement.
- Jeffrey Nguyen for assisting in collecting 3D models for importing, writting the README, scripting of the camera movement, and handling of back-end logistics.
- Team of GraphBox for assisting us with the format of the README. 

This is a project created and designed for the CS460 course at The University of Massachusetts - Boston, [CS460.org](https://cs460.org/), and is NOT intended to be completely replicated for future students.

Thank you to Prof. Daniel Haehn and the staff of the CS460 course for providing us with an incredible academical class and semester. We hope nothing but the best for you guys in the future moving forward!
